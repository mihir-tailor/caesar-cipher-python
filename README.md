## 📌 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is a simple encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, and so on. It's one of the oldest known encryption techniques.
